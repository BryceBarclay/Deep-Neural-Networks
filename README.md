## Getting Stock Data
To obtain stock data go https://finance.yahoo.com. Here:

(1) search a stock

(2) click on historical data

(3) edit the criteria and press apply

(4) click download data.

The data will download as a CSV file.

Alternatively, one can use the yfinance and the pandas_datareader.data libraries to download the data in a python script; however, this method has its difficulties.
